  ## Description
As a business owner
I want to be able to view and manage the departments, roles, and employees in my company
so that I can organize and plan my business

  ## Installation
  Run "npm install" from the command line.
  <br><br>

  ## Usage
  Run "npm start" from the command line.

You will see a menu appear in the command line, listing all the options for interacting with the CMS. The options are:
- View Departments
- View Roles
- View Employees
- Add Department
- Add Role
- Add Employee
- Update Employee Role

Simply select an option. For the "View" options you will immediately see a table displayed with the requested information. For "Add" or "Update" options, you will be prompted for any necessary fields to make the additions or updates. Once all necessary fields are entered, an error or success message will be displayed.

After every menu selection, the application will display output and then display the menu again so the user can continue interacting with the CMS. Choose "EXIT" from the menu to quit.
